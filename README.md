## Project Overview
For this project, we received a static website with completed HTML and CSS. Our goal was to work within the `main.js` file to render the page operational and interactive. The final product allows a user to enjoy a wide variety of motivational posters. At the click of a button, they can cycle through randomly generated posters. They can also navigate to a form to create and display their own poster- they will be able to input an image, title, and quote of their choosing. These input elements will then be added into the mix for random poster generation. Whichever instances the user likes can be saved at the click of a button. They can then navigate to a page of all the saved posters displayed in a grid with three columns. Double clicking on any of the individual posters on the grid will delete it from the batch of saved posters.

## Learning Goals
This was our first foray into using Javascript to dynamically manipulate HTML and a user-facing site based on user interaction. Our goals were to build on and reinforce foundational knowledge of the DOM andevent listeners/handlers. We were also able to apply our knowledge of classes, object instances, declaring and invoking functions, and conditionals/loops to a more complex problem that tied it all together.
